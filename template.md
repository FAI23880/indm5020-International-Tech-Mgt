#ABSTRACT:

  This paper introduces the concept of globalization, the most important factors in the transitional operation of a company. Globalization is the result of the pressure from the "stakeholders." Stakeholders are a group of people with an interest or concern in something, especially a business; they are the ones that the organization has to answer to if something goes right or wrong. Their activity inside the companies is to initiate new businesses, selling or deleting from their portfolio businesses.

 

#BIG IDEAS:

  In my opinion, one of the most important points made when defining globalization is that globalization is directly interacting with people, companies, and government from different countries and regions.  It is directed by the international commerce and by foreign investments. This process can change or affect the environment, culture, and the political system of a country, which is very dangerous.

  The article also talks about how globalization forces economies to relax their settlements in favor of big companies, which the effect creates new powers that some time surpasses the state structure.  In the country that I was born, we have a presence of a multinational organization called Odebrecht; they have a net income of 31.0 billion. Odebrecht is the perfect example of surpassing the state structure. They had so much power that they were putting pressure on the government to give them a new project and the government were complying with them.

  On another hand, the article talks about the idea of “the global state”, which means that countries will depend on each other, and they will be able to help each other by trading goods and services. Thus, countries will specialize in their area of strength. This is one of the good reason for a country/company to enter the globalization method.

 

#STRENGTHS

  The article did an excellent job explaining the implications of globalization of a company and how it affects the global economy and climate in other countries. It explains that market economy has one purpose and motivation, which is to introduce themselves in different parts of the world as a geopolitical motivation.  In the market economy, the economic activity has some premeditated motivations, intended and orientated, outside its perennial purposes. These are induced by the concrete geopolitical, political conditions in which the economic politics that are aimed at certain objectives. The more companies that country has abroad, the more economic power the country will have.

 

#WEAKNESSES:

  One of the weaknesses that this article has is that it does not explain in detail how globalization affects small companies in thirty world countries. For example, if we bring Amazon to one of the underdeveloped countries it will hurt the small shops that sell X or Y products because they do not have the buying power to compete with the multinational companies. We have to make sure that before a country starts opening the borders to technology and manufacture, it is the countries’ duty to integrate the small business to the new system.

 

#VALUE ADDED

  It thinks that this is an excellent article. It was fascinating to see how multinationals operate in other countries and the power they have. Usually, when we see companies like Corning, Verizon, Coca-Cola, and others, we never stop to think what this company is doing in other countries and how they are changing the environment either positive or negative.

 

#SELF ASSESSMENT

  This article helped me to understand that multinationals play a big role in other countries’ economies. I believe that I should do more research on how technology affects the culture and the business of every country. That will help me to understand how technology changes society.
